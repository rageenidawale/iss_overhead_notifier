## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required package:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Location

Modify these variables in the script to your **latitude** and **longitude**:

```python
MY_LAT = 18.520430   # Your latitude
MY_LONG = 73.856743  # Your longitude
```

You can find your **latitude** and **longitude** using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Email Credentials

Update these fields with your email details:

```python
MY_EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"
MY_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If using Gmail, you may need to enable ["Less Secure Apps"](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) or generate an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

Execute the script:

```bash
python iss_tracker.py
```

The script will check every **60 seconds** if the ISS is overhead and send an email if it is **nighttime**.

## üî¨ How It Works

1. **Fetches ISS location** from the [Open Notify API](http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json).
2. **Checks if ISS is near** your coordinates (¬±5¬∞).
3. **Determines local sunrise/sunset** using [Sunrise-Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api).
4. **If ISS is overhead & it's nighttime**, sends an **email alert**.
5. **Repeats every 60 seconds**.
